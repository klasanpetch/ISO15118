How to use Client(EV)

The first thing you should do in the clients files is go to client/src/test and open the file main_example.c to input the paths of the CA files you have created. Then, set the PORT_NUMBER   for communicating with the server (EVSE) and make sure the port number matches the server's.

In communication, we will use the wolfSSL library. You need to ensure that you installed it.

After that, you need to change the path to execute the makefile by running cd /client/Release and then execute make all. Afterward, run the program using the command ./CLIENTEV <SERVER_IP_ADDRESS> and make sure server is already run.


If you want to understand how each function works, you can look at that function in the code. I have added comments to the API to make it easier to use the code.

How to use server(EVSE)

The first thing you should do in the server files is go to server/src/test and open the file main_example.c to input the paths of the self-signed certificate and private key you have created. Then, set the port for communicating with the client (EV) in the server_tls function.

In communication, we will use the wolfSSL library. You need to ensure that you have downloaded it.

After that, you need to change the path to execute the makefile by running cd /server/Release and then execute make all. Afterward, run the program using the command ./SERVEREVSE.


If you want to understand how each function works, you can look at that function in the code. I have added comments to the API to make it easier to use the code.
